# MazeMaker
This is a simple Maze Generator created in Java. It uses a depth-first search algorithm to determine how the maze will be created!
The user enters numbers into a Scanner to represent the rows and columns of the maze. The numbers that they enter are multipled by 2 and increased by 1.
The algorithm uses a stack made of Point objects. Once the stack is depleted, the algorithm is completed and the maze has been fully created. 
While the algorithm is going, it uses depth-first search to find where to cut out the next point in the maze.
